# Artemis-Financial-Software-Security

In this project, I worked with a client, Artemis Financial, who asked me to enhance the security of its online application to ensure that its financial details are not compromised and that it is protected against cyber attacks. Thus, I tried to analyze possible security threats and use secure coding practices to ensure that the application is secure. I used OWASP Dependency-Check to scan for possible vulnerabilities that the program may have, which helped me to understand the possible threats that the software may face. This emphasized the significance of secure code in preventing data breaches, maintaining user information safety, and establishing system transparency. However, I encountered multiple challenges, the main one being determining which vulnerabilities were legitimate and which were false positives. This project helped me to understand how security software works in real life. After determining the actual threats, I took measures to ensure that the program is secure by using SHA-256 hashing to ensure data integrity and to detect any possible data tampering. In addition, I used HTTPS and TLS encryption to ensure that any data communication or transfer is secure. After refactoring the code and implementing these security practices, I ensured that the application still works as expected. Then, I performed another security scan to ensure that these new changes introduced no new vulnerabilities. To ensure that this project was completed successfully, I implemented various tools such as Java Keytool, dependency-check, and secure coding practices, which are all tools I will implement in my future projects to identify vulnerabilities and determine the best mitigation techniques. With all these factors in mind, this project is one of the best additions to my portfolio since it highlights my ability to identify security threats and implement appropriate solutions, which will be of great importance to my future employers.
